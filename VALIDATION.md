# Validation record

Validated on 2026-10-24 (America/Sao_Paulo).

## Executed checks

- R CMD build completed successfully.
- R CMD check --no-manual --no-build-vignettes: **Status: OK**,
  zero errors, zero warnings, zero notes.
- Full test suite: **144 expectations passed**, zero failures, errors, warnings,
  or skips.
- A separate source installation with OpenMP disabled passed the same
  **144 expectations** and reported OpenMP unavailable.
- A fresh R process loaded an ONNX model and predicted without loading
  the xgboost namespace.
- Source archive contains no object files or compiled libraries.

Environment: Windows 10 x64, R 4.6.0, GCC/G++ 14.3.0, cpp11 0.5.5,
S7 0.2.2, and XGBoost 3.2.1.1. C source compilation used GNU C17;
the bridge used C++17. OpenMP-enabled and disabled builds were both executed.

## Independent ONNX Runtime C API comparison

The exported graphs were executed by the official Windows x64 ONNX Runtime
1.20.1 release, loaded through a separately compiled development executable.
Neither this library nor the executable is required by the installed package.

Twelve deterministic scenarios each used 500 rows, five numerical features,
missing values, 25 boosting rounds, and a fixed seed. They covered all six
objectives, intercepts 0.2 and 0.8, automatically estimated intercepts, an
all-positive binary training set, and two-class and three-class softmax models.

| Comparison | Largest absolute difference across all scenarios |
| --- | ---: |
| tidyonnx vs XGBoost | 9.5367431640625e-7 |
| tidyonnx vs ONNX Runtime | 1.1920928955078125e-7 |
| XGBoost vs ONNX Runtime | 9.5367431640625e-7 |

The acceptance threshold was 5e-6. All scenarios passed.
For multi:softmax, probabilities were independently reconstructed from
XGBoost's output margins; the package's argmax output is tested separately.

## Coverage and boundaries

Tests exercise numerical boundaries at a strict split threshold, learned
missing-value directions, integer and double storage, empty batches,
feature reordering, target-label persistence, file and RDS restoration,
prediction methods, malformed protobuf input, invalid graph topology,
missing node references, out-of-range features, external metadata-free models,
packed and unpacked attributes, and deterministic predictions at 1/2/4
configured worker limits.

The thread tests establish deterministic output under configured limits;
they do not instrument observed worker counts or prove a speedup.
No Intel oneAPI, AVX-512, GPU, large-model performance benchmark, exhaustive
fuzzing, or general ONNX conformance result is claimed. Linux and macOS checks
are configured in GitHub Actions and should be assessed from their actual run
results. No CRAN submission has been made.
